    Additional Notes:
    
    1. Only include permissions that your app actually uses
    2. Customize the descriptions to match your app's specific features
    3. Keep descriptions clear, concise, and user-friendly
    4. Explain the benefit to the user, not just the technical requirement
    5. Update descriptions when app features change
    6. Test permission requests in the app to ensure they work correctly
    7. Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for permission requests
    
    Best Practices:
    - Request permissions only when needed (just-in-time)
    - Provide clear explanations before requesting permissions
    - Allow users to decline permissions gracefully
    - Provide alternative functionality when permissions are denied
    - Test permission flows thoroughly before App Store submission
